    <h1>Design</h1>
    <h3>What is Design?</h3>
    <p>
        Design is a creative activity that involves planning and creating something functional, often new, to solve a specific problem. The goal of design is to add value and make something more useful for its users.
    </p>
    <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
    <p>
        Graphic design emphasizes <span>communication</span>. The goal is to ensure that everyone interprets the message in the same way.
    </p>
    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <p>
        Typography relates to the arrangement of text, making it easier to read and more visually appealing.
    </p>
    <h3>Elements of Design</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Line</li>
        <span>Functions:</span>
        <ul>
            <li>Organizes composition</li>
            <li>Creates patterns and textures</li>
            <li>Communicates movement</li>
            <li>Creates illusions</li>
            <li>Highlights or emphasizes specific elements</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Shape</li>
        <span>Types:</span>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Geometric</span>: Precise shapes like squares, triangles, circles, etc.</li>
            <li><span>Organic</span>: Irregular shapes found in nature</li>
            <li>These can be combined to create logos, illustrations, decorations, and patterns.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Color</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Monochromatic</span>: Different shades of the same color</li>
            <li><span>Analogous</span>: Colors next to each other on the color wheel</li>
            <li><span>Complementary</span>: Colors opposite each other on the color wheel (contrasting)</li>
            <li><span>Split-complementary</span>: A color and the two colors next to its complement</li>
            <li><span>Triadic</span>: Three colors equally spaced on the color wheel</li>
            <li><span>Tetradic</span>: Four colors forming a rectangle or square on the color wheel</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Texture</li>
        <p>
            Refers to the surface quality of a design. Texture makes a design look more real and engaging by giving the viewer a sense of how it would feel to touch the design.
        </p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Principles of Design</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span>Unity</span>: The elements of a design should work together as a whole</li>
        <li><span>Balance</span>: The visual weight of elements should be distributed evenly, either symmetrically or asymmetrically</li>
        <li><span>Proportion</span>: The size of elements in a design should be harmonious</li>
        <li><span>Emphasis</span>: The focal point of a design (or the highlight)</li>
        <li><span>Rhythm</span>: The repetition of elements in a design that create movement and flow</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These principles and elements form the foundation of effective design. When applied correctly, they enhance both functionality and visual appeal.
